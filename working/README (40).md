# Working

    #### Description:

    In the file called working.py, it implement's a function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats below 
    and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized 
    (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are representative of actual times, 
    not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

    Formats:
    
    8:00 AM to 4:00 PM
    8 AM to 4 PM
