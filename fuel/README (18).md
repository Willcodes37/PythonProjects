# Fuel Gauge

    #### Description:

    In the file called fuel.py, it prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, 
    as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, 
    output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.
    For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.
